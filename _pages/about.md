I am a Quantitative Researcher working in the financial industry using statistical and machine learning methods to develop predictive signals. 
I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. 

I enjoy reading Kaggle notebooks and occasionally do take part in competitive competitions. I was recently ranked 7th on [Kaggle : Jane Street Market Prediction Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/leaderboard). I hate recurring manual tasks in my work and prefer automating as much as possible. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports and video games with friends. I am always up for hearing better ways of automation and doing some brainstorming on a research topic unrelated to my everyday work.
